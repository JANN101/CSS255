# SUMMARY
  Liam wanted to create an online system that helped train new drivers to pass their driving tests, so he hired a small development company to create his system. He envisioned a system that, to sum it up, lets users take online practce tests and physical driving tests. He specifically wanted an entirely online system that is cloud-based.

# WHAT WENT WELL? IMPROVEMENTS?
  In my opinion, I think I did well providing specific requirements and "wants" from the client. For the project overall, I think I did a good job creating UML diagrams and presenting information about the DriverPass system. If I could revisit a specific part of this project, the only thing I can think of to revisit is one of the diagrams, and I cannot remember which one, is missing a small detail (so small I can't remember it). I could not fix it in Project Two because Lucid Chart only lets you have three editable diagrams at once with the free account option, and I did not want to have to recreate the entire diagram again, so I left it.

# USER NEEDS
  The most important rule in business is to give the customer what they want. It is very simple to see what Liam wanted. Some wants of his included having online practice tests, having physical drving tests, having different packages to select from for a driving test, and having a cloud-based program. These are only some of the requests. It was easy to go through the interview transcript to see what Liam was requesting, and he even provided a basic idea of the layout he wanted.

# DESIGN APPROACH
  While I did not fully design a system and only provided the basics, I think I would approach the design of a new system / software would be to either do an interview with the client or get a list of specific requirements from the client. I would then create a document like I did in this course breaking down what the client wanted. I would send that back to the client to get confirmation that I had the right idea. I could then go on to create UML diagrams, again, reconfirming with the client, and go from there. It is important to obtain client approval each step of the way to ensure the end result will meet or exceed expectations.
